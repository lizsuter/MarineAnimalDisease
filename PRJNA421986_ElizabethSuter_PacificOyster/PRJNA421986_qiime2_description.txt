The phyloseq object in this file are data processed from Green et al. 2019 (doi: 10.1007/s00248-018-1242-9), NCBI BioProject # PRJNA421986.
The ASV count table was produced using Qiime2 (v. 2020.02), calling DADA2 for denoising, merging, and ASV inference, and a Silva v132 Naive 
Bayes classifier for taxonomy calling.
Samples were collected from Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) samples in Australia. AUthors performed a simulated heat wave in mesocosms to test
impacts on microbiome.
The phyloseq object, ps_filtered, was filtered to remove a subset of samples that were also used to test the impact of anitibiotics. The remaining 
samples here were not treated with antibiotics. The remaining samples correspond to a time-zero (field) collection and a time-4day collection from two 
different heat stress conditions (20˚C and 25˚C). Each assay has biological triplicates and thus there are 9 total samples.
On day 4 in the 25˚C treatment, the oysters were showing signs of mortality.
The metadata in this file come from the SraRunTable and have been modified to clearly indicate temperature and mortality data.
The otu_table object in the phyloseq object contains absolute abundaces of ASVs, without any tranformation or agglomeration at higher taxonomic levels.
